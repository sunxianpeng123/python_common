============================================================

This repo contains many state-of-art Neural Network Architectures(NNA). You can
play with them on CIFAR-10 dataset for the classification works. You can change 
model in the 'main.py', and then `python main.py`. 

o  VGG16
o  Resnet18, Resnet34, Resnet50, Resnet101, Resnet152
